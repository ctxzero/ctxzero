## 🚀 About Me

My passion for technology started early in life — as a kid, I was always fascinated by how systems and software work under the hood. This curiosity led me to experiment with computers, learn programming basics, and explore IT concepts long before discovering cybersecurity.

Today, I am fully dedicated to mastering offensive security and penetration testing. For over a month now, I have been grinding on TryHackMe, focusing on real-world scenarios and hands-on labs to sharpen my skills and build practical experience.

My mission is to become one of the **best Red Team operators** in the industry — proactively identifying and mitigating risks before attackers do, helping organizations strengthen their security posture.
