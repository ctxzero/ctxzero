**19 y/o | Aspiring Red Teamer | Penetration Tester in Training**

## 🚀 About Me

I'm **ctxzero**, a deeply curious and driven aspiring red teamer. From a young age, I was fascinated by how systems, networks, and software operate beneath the surface. That curiosity led me to self-study programming and IT fundamentals — and eventually, into the world of ethical hacking.

I’m currently fully committed to building a solid, real-world pentesting skill set by grinding hands-on platforms like **TryHackMe**, diving into the offensive security world one box at a time.

> 🧠 *"My goal? To become one of the sharpest Red Team operators in the industry — technical, creative, and ethical."*
