## 🚀 About Me

I'm **ctxzero**, an ambitious and curious aspiring red teamer focused on offensive security and penetration testing. Since I was a kid, I’ve always been fascinated by computers — how they work, how they break, and how they can be protected.

I learn quickly, adapt fast, and immerse myself deeply in every topic I touch. This field isn’t just a hobby for me — it’s what I want to build my future around. Ethical hacking combines everything I love: logic, creativity, challenge, and real-world impact.

I’m currently focused on building deep, practical skills through platforms like **TryHackMe**, where I work daily on challenges and document what I learn.
